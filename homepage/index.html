            <h1>About me</h1>
            <p>Hello. I'm usually known as starfire, a riichi mahjong enthusiast.</p>
            <p>
                I have been playing this <del>wonderful</del> game for about 10 years.
                For better or for worse, this game has drastically changed my life.
            </p>
            <p>
                I understand that it looks like a very hard game to learn, but in reality it's not that hard.
                You just need some times to get familiar with it, and once you get the key mechanics it's really fun!
            </p>
            <p>
                IRL, I'm working as a neurologist. But I'm planning for a career change and this website would be once of the first efforts towards that goal.
                So if you have any suggestions about the mahjong content or the design of the website, please let me know!
