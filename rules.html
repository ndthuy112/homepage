        <h2>The flow of a Riichi mahjong game</h2>
        <p>Before even getting to know something as daunting as the mahjong tiles, or how to create a winning hand, how about a general understanding of how the game works first?</p>
        <p>
            Riichi mahjong is typically a 4-player game. This site will not cover the 3-player version for now.
        </p>
        <p>
            A Riichi mahjong game consists of <strong>rounds</strong>, or hands. In each round, usually, <strong>only one player can win that round and score points</strong>. 
            The points they scored are taken from other players.
        </p>
        <p>
            After the last round, the game ends. <strong>The one with the highest score then wins</strong>, simple as that. 
            <br>What I want to say here is that, the point is to <strong>win the game</strong>, and not just to win a round. To be more precise, it's about getting the best result in the game. 
            <br</br>Winning a round is just the way to score points, in order to head towards the goal of winning the game.
        </p>
        <p>
            The number of rounds, or hands, is not infinite. The base number is often 8 rounds, even though it depends on the rule for that game, and is also actually different from game to game.
            More on that later in this guide.
        </p>
        <p>Here is the example scoreboard of a game, for you to get a general idea:</p>
        <table class="table table-striped" data-toggle="table">

            This example game consists of 10 hands. The round winner is the only one to score points in that round. East 1, East 2 etc, are the names of the rounds.
            <br>That amount of points is paid by one other player if they are the one to "finish" the hand of the winner, and by all other players if the winner "finish" their hand by themselves.
            <br>A round can also ends in a draw. Let's not go into it for now.

        <h2>Riichi mahjong tiles</h2>
        <p>Remembering the tiles might be overwhelming at first glance, but it's actually not that much harder compared to remembering the cards in a 52-card deck</p>
        <p>The tiles can be divided into two main groups: Numbered tiles and Word tiles.</p>
        <h3>Numbered tiles</h3>
        <p>There are 3 suits of number tiles.</p>
        <h4>"Man" tiles</h4>
        <div class="hand">
            <img src="tiles/1m.gif" title="1m">
            <img src="tiles/2m.gif" title="2m">

            <img src="tiles/8m.gif" title="8m">
            <img src="tiles/9m.gif" title="9m">
        </div>
        <h4>"Pin" tiles</h4>
        <div class="hand">
            <img src="tiles/1p.gif" title="1p">
            <img src="tiles/2p.gif" title="2p">
            <img src="tiles/3p.gif" title="3p">
            <img src="tiles/4p.gif" title="4p">
            <img src="tiles/5p.gif" title="5p">
            <img src="tiles/6p.gif" title="6p">
            <img src="tiles/7p.gif" title="7p">
            <img src="tiles/8p.gif" title="8p">
            <img src="tiles/9p.gif" title="9p">
        </div>
        <h4>"Sou" tiles</h4>
        <div class="hand">
            <img src="tiles/1s.gif" title="1s">
            <img src="tiles/2s.gif" title="2s">
            <img src="tiles/3s.gif" title="3s">
            <img src="tiles/4s.gif" title="4s">
            <img src="tiles/5s.gif" title="5s">
            <img src="tiles/6s.gif" title="6s">
            <img src="tiles/7s.gif" title="7s">
            <img src="tiles/8s.gif" title="8s">
            <img src="tiles/9s.gif" title="9s">
        </div>
        <p>
            Here I use the Japanese name for the tiles. The tile with number 1 in the man suit will be called 1 man, for example.
            <br>In the English speaking community, it's more common to pronounce the number in English (one) then the suit in Japanese (man)
            <br>You can go full Japanese, or full English, in this case the suits' names are character, dot (or circle) and bamboo respectively.
        </p>
        <p>Let's go a little more in to details.</p>
        <p>
            <b>The man tiles</b> are the tiles with number written in kanji (Chinese character) above and a red kanji below (which you don't need to understand)
            <br>You do need to eventually remember the number part though. Some hundred of matches would do.
            In this guide, you can see the name of a tile by hovering over that tile.
            For example, if you hover the 1 man tile you'd see "1m".
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>The pin tiles</b> don't need much explanation. 1 pin has 1 circle, 9 pin has 9 circles. 
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>The sou tiles</b> also. The exception is that 1 sou has the bird image. 
            8 sou is not an exception, 2 "M" have a total of 8 lines.
        </p>
        <h3>Word tiles</h3>
        <p>There are 2 groups of word tiles.</p>
        <h4>Wind tiles</h4>
        <div class="hand">
            <img src="tiles/1z.gif" title="Ton/East">
            <img src="tiles/2z.gif" title="Nan/South">
            <img src="tiles/3z.gif" title="Sha/West">
            <img src="tiles/4z.gif" title="Pei/North">
        </div>
        <h4>Dragon tiles</h4>
        <div class="hand">
            <img src="tiles/5z.gif" title="Haku/White">
            <img src="tiles/6z.gif" title="Hatsu/Green">
            <img src="tiles/7z.gif" title="Chun/Red">
        </div>
        <p>
            <b>The wind tiles</b> has the names of four cardinal directions.
            <br>In the order of appearance above, they are East, South, West, North. Try to remember them in this order, ESWN.
            <br>The Japanese names are Ton, Nan, Sha, Pei. Even though I prefer to go with Japanese, there's no problem with using English here.
        </p>
        <p>
            The shape of the Japanese kanji on the tiles would remind you of the shape of the abbreviated characters for the corresponding words in English:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>E has a rectangular shape</li>
            <li>The right "border" of the South tile is a curve that somewhat looks like the S character</li>
            <li>W has a trapezoid shape</li>
            <li>North tile looks like an upside-down N character</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <b>The dragon tiles</b> can be remembered by colors, White, Green and Red. 
            <br>People more often than not use the Japanese names for those, but people would understand if you use the English names.
        </p>
        <p>Again, you can hover your mouse over the tiles in this guide to see their names.</p>
        <p>
            The biggest difference from a 52-card deck is that <strong>each type of tiles has 4 copies!</strong>
            <br>For example, a Riichi mahjong tile set has 4 identical 1 man, 4 identical 2 pin, 4 identical East tiles, etc.
            <br>So there are 136 tiles total in a typical Riichi mahjong tile set.
