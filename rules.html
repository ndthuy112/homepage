        <h2>The flow of a Riichi mahjong game</h2>
        <p>Before even getting to know something as daunting as the mahjong tiles, or how to create a winning hand, how about a general understanding of how the game works first?</p>
        <p>
            Riichi mahjong is typically a 4-player game. This site will not cover the 3-player version for now.
        </p>
        <p>
            A Riichi mahjong game consists of <strong>rounds</strong>, or hands. In each round, usually, <strong>only the fastest player can win that round and score points</strong>. 
            The points they scored are taken from other players.
        </p>
        <p>
            After the last round, the game ends. <strong>The one with the highest score then wins</strong>, simple as that. 
            <br>What I want to say here is that, the point is to <strong>win the game</strong>, and not just to win a round. To be more precise, it's about getting the best result in the game. 
            <br</br>Winning a round is just the way to score points, in order to head towards the goal of winning the game.
        </p>
        <p>
            The number of rounds, or hands, is not infinite. The base number is often 8 rounds, even though it depends on the rule for that game, and is also actually different from game to game.
            More on that later in this guide.
        </p>
        <p>Here is the example scoreboard of a game, for you to get a general idea:</p>

                <th>Player 4</th>

        <p>
            This example game consists of 10 hands. The round winner is the only one to score points in that round.
            <br>That amount of points is paid by one other player if they are the one to "finish" the hand of the winner, and by all other players if the winner "finish" their hand by themselves.
            <br>A round can also end in a draw.
